    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Social media has become an inseparable part of modern life. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube connect us with the world, but their excessive use can silently harm our mental health. Constant scrolling, comparison, and exposure to unrealistic lifestyles often lead to stress, anxiety, and depression.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Negative Impacts</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Research shows that spending long hours on social media reduces self-esteem and increases loneliness. Notifications and likes create a cycle of dependency, where individuals seek validation online instead of building real-life connections.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Positive Uses</strong></h2>
    <p>
        On the other hand, social media can be used positively for education, awareness, and staying informed. It helps students access knowledge, share ideas, and build communities. The key lies in balance and mindful usage.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, social media is a powerful tool, but it can act as a “silent killer” of mental health if not managed wisely. Students and young professionals must learn to control their digital habits to protect their emotional well-being and focus on healthier lifestyles.
