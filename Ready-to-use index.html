        <p>
            Social media has become an inseparable part of our daily lives. It connects us with friends, family, and the world, but its excessive use can silently harm our mental health. Constant scrolling, comparison, and exposure to unrealistic lifestyles often lead to stress, anxiety, and depression.
        </p>

        <p>
            Research shows that spending long hours on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok can reduce self-esteem and increase feelings of loneliness. Notifications and likes create a cycle of dependency, where individuals seek validation online instead of building real-life connections.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, social media can also be used positively — for education, awareness, and staying informed. The key lies in balance: using these platforms mindfully, setting time limits, and prioritizing face-to-face interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, social media is a powerful tool, but it can act as a “silent killer” of mental health if not managed wisely. Students and young professionals must learn to control their digital habits to protect their emotional well-being and focus on healthier lifestyles.
